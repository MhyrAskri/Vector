## Familiarity with vector
- Familiarity with vector and its commands such as **at** to access the desired value in vector and the important **push back** command to add new items to the end of vector.
- Familiarity with how to build a vector and how to specify its data type (vector<**data type**>).
- Build 2D vector (vector<vector<data type>>).
- Change open vector values via the **at** command (vector.at(index)).
- Specify the vector size using the **size** command (vector.size()).
- The important point is that the vector index starts from **zero**, which means that if the vector size is 6, to access its values, the indexes are from 0 to 5.
